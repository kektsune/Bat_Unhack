Features:
- Create and use an in-game username and password
- Execute simulated commands to list, open, and delete files
- View system health and diagnostics through commands
- Access a help command that lists all available commands
- Purge the virus or temporarily alleviate its symptoms via commands

IMPORTANT: This program is only known to run on Windows thus far. If run on macOS or Linux, it may not function properly.

This is the first release of Bat_Unhack. Bug reports and feedback are welcome via the Issues tab.
